My name is Wilson Kung.  I have a background in Economics, Finance, Mathematics and now, Data Science.  I've worked at several investment banks and hedge funds from structuring credit derivative to conducting quantitative investment research.  Recently, I have endeavored to learn data science.  This has involved learning a basket of new tools and techniques including the Python programming language.
